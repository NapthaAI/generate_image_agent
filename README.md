# Generate Image Agent

This is a simple agent module to demonstrate how to use tool calls in an agent. You can check out other examples of agent, orchestrator and environment modules using the CLI command with the [Naptha SDK](https://github.com/NapthaAI/naptha-sdk). 

Naptha [Modules](https://docs.naptha.ai/NapthaModules/overview) are the building blocks of multi-agent applications, which enable them to run across multiple nodes.
